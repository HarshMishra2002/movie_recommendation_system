Recommendation systems have become one of the most important aspect of machine learning these days as every company needs it to make their product more
personalized for better user experience.

There are three major types of Recommendation System :

Content based filtering

Collaborative filtering

Hybrid approach


Content based filtering- Here we see users history and figure out what type of content the user likes, then we try to recommend the similar type of content. 
                         So the recommendation depends on the users past data.
                         
Eg. In the movie recommendation system which we will built today, first we ask the user to give the input as name of his favorite film 
and then we will recommend similar movies.
                     
                     
2. Collaborative filtering- In this type of recommendation systems, users past data is not a matter of concern instead we find out similar users and then 
                        recommend the product.
                        
Eg. In any E-commerce website if you buy certain item, the algorithm shows an column of products which was previously 
brought by someone else who has similar order history as of yours.
                  
                  
3. Hybrid approach- Take this as a mixture of both the above types.

Eg. In Netflix, shows and movies are recommended by both ways- your history as well as your choices made by a user to tend 
to have a similar interest to you.
                       
Today I have implemented content based filtering in an end to end ml project- Movie Recommendation System
